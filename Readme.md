# Events Manager Github *fork* -> don't expect any future changes
_______
⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️
_______

This repository **is an (unmaintained) fork** of the original SVN versioned [events manager wordpress plugin (svn)](https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/events-manager/).
The purpose of this forked repo was to provide a snapshot with a somewhat complete history, up until revision `= 7.2.2.1 =` (see the original readme.txt file: [docs/original-readme.txt](docs/original-readme.txt))

As a pseudo-archived repo, it'll be mainly use to derive internal code structure and understand how the plugin is working.
One interesting area would be to isolate all the "hooks" of the plugin, to be used within custom extensions.

# Contributing?
This repo is nowhere near to be "complete", I couldn't correctly extract git tags from the git-svn command alone, further history checking might be required (and actually **is** required).
For now, this repo doesn't accept issues (I cannot do the maintenance, after all), and would probably never be substantially updated.

# Credits
All credits should go to the original team of this plugin on WordPress ecosystem.

# Notes
It would be much nicer to setup a proper **mirror** of the original SVN repository, so that we would only get an image of the source code on GitHub and not already-dead repos like this one.

Should you have an idea on how to do this, feel free to step up.
